Ask.

This app just takes in lines on stdin and asks you about each of them.
If you answer 'y' or 'Y' it outputs the line on stdout.

Otherwise it doesn't.

Intended to be used as a filter.

Ex. 
ls | ask | xargs rm
(Not recommended)

OR

ls | grep '^somePrefix' | ask | xargs git add

I guess if you wanted you could actually use it to filter lines in a file
cat animals | ask > animalsThatAreCute

You could also just use it with single items in a loop where something more important happens.

while read url; do
	curl "$line" | less
	echo "$line" | ask >> BookMark
done

To make up some useless example.
